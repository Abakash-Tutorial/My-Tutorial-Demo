  <p >In the Indian states of West Bengal and Puri, Odisha (also known as Orissa), the Hindu god Krishna is venerated as Jagannatha (Sanskrit: "Lord of the World").

  The city of Puri is dominated by the 12th-century Jagannatha Temple. The sanctuary of the temple contains wooden statues of Jagannatha, his sister Subhadra, and their brother Balarama.
  
  Unlike the more well-known Buddha, Jagannatha is regularly portrayed as one of Vishnu's ten avatars (incarnations) in modern art produced in Puri.
  
  Lord Jagannath is another name for Lord Krishna. They are both identical.
  
  In order to express his transcendental feelings or maha bhava, Krishna assumed the form of Lord Jagannath. Krishna is hence same as Lord Jagannath</p>
